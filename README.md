# Project4-Overview
This project is an analysis of the Rotten Tomatoes Movies dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about various movies, including ratings, reviews, and other attributes.
The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas libraries. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were used to examine the data, identify patterns, and extract insights.
# Requirements
1. Data can be accessed in the /Resourse folder in the SQLite DB named movie.db (the orignal source data is rotten_tomatoes_movies.csv)
2. Panda Libraries needed installed in your Jupyter Notebook can be found in the Library Import Requirement document located in the /Resource folder.

# Files
1. The exploratory analysis.ipynb and EDA_YZ.ipynb was utilized to create the charts used in the presentation.
2. The rotten_tomatoes_ml.ipynb and Feature_Selection.ipynb utilized for the ML component of this project.
3. the sqlite_create.ipynb was utilized to create the movie.db using Sqlite.
# Conclusion
The project demonstrates the use of EDA techniques to extract insights from a dataset, and serves as a starting point for further exploration of the data and ML portion of this project.
